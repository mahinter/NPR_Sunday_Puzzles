The letter Y isn't used.import csvimport reinput_file = csv.reader(open("country_nationalities.csv"))countries = dict()# put all the countries in a hashfor row in input_file:    country = re.sub('[aeiou]', '', row[0].lower() , flags=re.I)    countries[country] = row[0].lower()input_file = csv.reader(open("country_nationalities.csv"))for row in input_file:    nationality = re.sub('[aeiou]', '', row[1].lower() , flags=re.I)    if (nationality in countries):        if (countries[nationality] != row[0].lower()):            print(countries[nationality])                print(row[1].lower())
